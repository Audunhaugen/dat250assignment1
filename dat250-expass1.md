DAT250 - Assignment 1, installation and setup

* technical problems that I encountered during installation of the software development environment and how I have solved them
  * I had most of the tools already downloaded. Although gradle is kind of built into IntelliJ, I have not learnt enough about this. So I downloaded it as instructed and eventually got to build the project.
  * The second challenge was installing and setting up podman. It is a tool which I have never used before, so it took some time figuring out. Not necessarily any issues, just some time. 
* how I have validated (checked) that the software development environment is working
  * For the tools downloaded, commands for checking versions was used in the commandline. The rest was verified by checking its behavior against what was said in the instructions.
* technical problems and how I (tried to) solve them
  * No known problems
* any pending issues with this assignment which I did not manage to solve.
  * No known problems
